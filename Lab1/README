## Background
How to generate sentences is a classic problem. From the 1940s, when Turing proposed machine intelligence, he used the ability of humans to communicate with computers smoothly. A prerequisite for talking to a computer is that the computer can generate language.
In the movie "Western World", the method of robotic language generation is the method of using SyntaxTree to generate language. I implemented a rule-based sentence generator via python.
