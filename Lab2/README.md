## Background
The ability of a machine to talk has long been an important indicator of whether a robot is intelligent. Alan Turing has already proposed a method to test the intelligence of machines in his article. This method mainly examines whether humans can distinguish each other from robots or real humans through the content of conversations.
We provide a quick template-based dialogue robot configuration method. The user only needs to enter the sentence and the template we defined, and the program can reply to the user. The template is a rule with the questioner's sentence as the key and the answerer's sentence as the value.
